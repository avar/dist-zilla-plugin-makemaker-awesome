Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MakeMaker-Awesome

{{$NEXT}}
  - In many cases (perhaps all), this plugin would miss a minimum perl
    version. This happened because it attempted to look determine this by
    looking at the distro's prereqs _during_ the prereq registration phase,
    which cannot work properly. This has been fixed, but the downside is that
    this plugin may end up requiring a minimum ExtUtils::MakeMaker of 6.5702
    for Perls < 5.14. Fixed by Dave Rolsky. GH #9.

0.49      2021-09-04 20:21:07Z
  - switched from MooseX::Types to Types::Standard
  - extracted the hashref of template arguments out to a sub
    ("template_arguments") to allow for method modification (RT#137585)

0.48      2019-04-27 05:03:11Z
  - ensure DOTFILES and DOTDIRS are copied over from shared dirs during
    install, matching the behaviour of <Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker>.

    configure-requires prereqs and WriteMakefile arguments (0.44)

0.44      2018-06-18 00:50:40Z
  - also use quotes when testing ExtUtils::MakeMaker for the existence of
    various features
